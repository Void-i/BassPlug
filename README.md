BassPlug has a new helper [mateon1](http://github.com/mateon1) who should help push some regular updates for BassPlug while I am busy taking Web Dev courses. There are some new features and bug fixes that should be coming up and the complete re-write isn't too far off at this point.

#####Some things we are trying to get done in no particular order -

- [ ] Fix the init so that the event listeners aren't messed up for minute or so when the script is first applied
- [ ] Fix the script so that it stacks properly
- [ ] Upgrade the userlist a bit with with better icons and add icons for ambassadors 
- [ ] Make the strobe and lights out buttons look better
-  -  Fixed the stupid stream button
- [ ] Work on a better video hiding system
- [ ] Add some more moderation functions / fix the uncompleted ones (fixbooth) / improve the current ones
-  -  Added /kickskip    
- [ ] Redesign the menu
- [ ] Possibly add custom chat colors
- [ ] Change autojoin and autowoot to use the services instead of .click()

#####Not necassarily related to the script plans -

- [ ] Give the site a bit of a facelift
- [ ] Make some better documentation 
- [ ] Get a bug report system in place
